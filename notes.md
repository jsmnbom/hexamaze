# Hexamaze

## Todo

- Powerups (picking up gives you a random one, clicking on it (or space) will activate it, it will get bigger, blink, and a timer will appear at the bottom of the screen)
	- Walk through walls (hexagon with double outline)
	- See the world for a few secs (lightbulb)
	- Breadcumbs - not timed, but limited by amount (multiple dots)
	- Look through walls - gradient length = 1 (gradient cone?)
	- Show walls - make walls white (half white half black hexagon)
- Music
